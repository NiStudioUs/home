It automatically categorizes messages into \"Personal\", \"Finance\", and \"Promos\", extracts transaction details to build a financial dashboard, and helps you stay on top of bill payments.\n\nBuilt with a \"Privacy First\" philosophy, all processing happens locally using a custom Regex engine. There are no external API calls for message analysis, ensuring your financial data remains secure on your phone.",
